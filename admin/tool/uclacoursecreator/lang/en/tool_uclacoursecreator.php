"USAGE: cli_autocreate.php ([TERM] ([TERM] ... ))
This script will build courses in the terms specified in course requestor.

You can specify as many terms as you would like.

Other options:

-c, --category:
    Auto create division and subject area categories, then nest the subject area in the division categories. If this option is disabled, then only subject area categories will be created.

--current-term:
    Run for the term that is specified in the configuration as the current term.

-f, fail:
    Used for testing reverting.

-h, --help:
    Show this message.

-m, --mute:
    Disables sending of mails.

-r, --revert:
    Experimental: This will enable reverting of failed built courses. Whenever the course creator decides that a term built failed, instead of leaving the courses in the Moodle DB, it will attempt to delete them.

-u, --unlock-first
    Attempt to remove a lock that may have been placed by another failed course creator run.
