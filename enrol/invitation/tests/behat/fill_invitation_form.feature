Feature: Invitation form
  In order to invite a user to have a role in my site
  As an instructor or project lead
  I want to be able to see a description of my role options and be alerted if I input an invalid email

  Scenario Outline: See role descriptions
    Given I am in a ucla environment
    And the following "users" exist:
      | username |
      | testuser |

    And the following ucla "roles" exist:
      | role |
      | <role1> |

    And I press "Control Panel"
    And I follow "Invite users"
