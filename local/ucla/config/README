UCLA Configuration System
=====================================

The configuration files for the UCLA CCLE-Shared Codebase of Moodle has
been organized in an attempt to simplify the act of moving code changes
from one development environment to another.

In general, the naming schema is follows:
<Host>_<Environment>_moodle-config.php

=====================================
For System Operators
=====================================

For each type of environment that you have running, create a symbolic link
(or an equivalent mechanism) to the proper configuration file that is wanted
to be used in your environment.

Please note that developers most likely do not know what exact settings you
may want on your running instance, so communication is required here to ensure
smooth feature roll-outs and bug fixes.

=====================================
For Developers
=====================================

When running a development instance, the easiest method to go with is to create
a copy of <Host>_development_moodle-config.php, name it config.php and put it
in your "moodle" directory. Then you need to fill in the specific instance
configurations, such as:
    $CFG->dbname
    $CFG->dbuser
    $CFG->dbpass
et cetera.

When finishing developing a new feature, you need to add the configuration
options to all of the environments for all hosts. While this seems like a
lot of work, it will prevent a lot of miscommunication errors that can
occur due to unstated configuration changes.

Please note that system operators may not understand implications and
functions that are available through the configuration files. Communication
here is ideal to ensure a smooth roll-out.
