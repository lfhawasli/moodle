/**
 * Command line script to run after every run of Moodle cron, to see if it
 * produced any errors.
 *
 * No output unless errors found, and then that is emailed by the cron job to
 * the cron job owner. So check who your ~moodle/.forward points to.
 *
 * When script is done reading log file, it writes filesize to file in
 * moodledata dir, so that next run will start where this one left off.
 *
 * DEPLOYMENT: Add to moodle cron crontab entry, as in the example below where
 * it fits between cron.php and logrotate.
 *
 * 5 * * * * /usr/bin/php /data/prod/moodle/admin/cli/cron.php >> /data/prod/moodledata/cron.log && /usr/bin/php /data/prod/moodle/local/ucla/cli/moodle_cron_errors.php && /usr/sbin/logrotate /home/moodle/logrotate.prod.cron.conf -s /home/moodle/prod.cron.logrotate-status
