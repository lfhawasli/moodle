<h1 class="headingblock">CCLE copyright information</h1>
<h2>Distributing copyrighted materials through CCLE</h2>
<p>
    All materials distributed through the CCLE system must be in compliance with
    <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/">Title 17</a> of the US Code,
    generally known as the <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/">1976 Copyright Law</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Every reproduction of a copyrighted work (which includes the act of uploading
    materials to CCLE) should be done in compliance with this law, and it is the
    user's responsibility to determine compliance. The instructor of record is
    responsible for all materials uploaded by teaching assistants, staff, or
    others doing so at the instructor's request.
</p>
<p>
    All users of CCLE should become familiar with <a href="http://policy.ucop.edu/advanced-search.php?action=search&op=results&lookup=1&keywords=copyright&subject_area=0&audience=0&responsible_office=0&search=Search">
    UC Systemwide Copyright Policies and Resources</a>, and can find additional
    resources and local information at the <a href="http://www.library.ucla.edu/support/publishing-data-management/scholarly-communication-resources-education/ucla-library-copyright-policies">
    UCLA Library Copyright site</a> or the <a href="http://copyright.universityofcalifornia.edu/">
    UC Copyright site</a>. Within these sites you'll find lots of helpful tools and guides.
</p>

<h2>Copyright ownership of course materials</h2>
<p>
    Though there are important exceptions included within the <a href="http://policy.ucop.edu/doc/2100004/CourseMaterials">
    2003 Policy on Ownership of Course Materials</a>, generally "ownership of the
    rights to Course Materials, including copyright, shall reside with the
    Designated Instructional Appointee who creates them." Anyone wishing to copy
    or redistribute materials found on CCLE should secure permission from the
    copyright owner before doing so.
</p>

<h2>Obtaining assistance</h2>
<p>
    Instructors are highly encouraged to use the following systems for posting
    materials to CCLE. Each one of these services has safeguards for insuring
    that materials are used in compliance with copyright law.

    echo '<h2>Past course access</h2>
    <p>
        To insure copyright compliance, students only have access to materials
        from a course during the term and for two weeks afterward; after that,
        materials are restricted from view. Therefore, we recommend you download
        any materials youâ€™d like to retain before that time. Please note, such
        material is meant for your personal educational use, and should not be
        shared with others outside this course, posted online, or otherwise
        distributed without permission from the copyright owner.
