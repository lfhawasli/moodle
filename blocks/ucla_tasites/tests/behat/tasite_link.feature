    In order to get to a TA site
    As a user
    I want to find the link next to the TA's name in the office hours block

   And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email |
      | student1 | Student | 1 | student1@asd.com |
      | teacher1 | Teacher | 1 | teacher1@asd.com |
