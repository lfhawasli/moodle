    And I turn editing mode on
    And I navigate to "Edit settings" node in "Course administration"    
    Then I should see "Edit course settings"
    And I expand all fieldsets
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | Your word for 'Instructor ' | Professor |
      | Your word for 'TA Instructor' | Graduate Professor |
      | Your word for 'Teaching Assistant (admin)' | TA Admin |

  Scenario: Check to see that Instructor role is renamed
    And I browse to site "C1"
    Then I should see "Professor"
    And I should see "Teacher Fellows"
    And I should not see "Graduate Professor"
    And I should not see "TA Admin"
    And I should see "1, Instructor" in the ".editinginstructor" "css_element" 
    And I should see "1, Teachinginstructor" in the ".editinginstructor" "css_element"
