Overview
==========

 The Mediasite Activity Module allows instructors to link secured Mediasite content to a Moodle course. Instructors can add new Mediasite links by searching for presentations or catalogs on the Mediasite Server. Once a link to a Mediasite presentation or catalog is added to a course, students can view the content without authenticating to the Mediasite Server using a different username. Additionally, students' usernames in Moodle can be used for Mediasite reporting.
